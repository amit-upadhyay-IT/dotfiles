Auto-Recurring SelfControl

This is an applescript that will automatically run the SelfControl app, for a given amount of time,
as specified by 'myTime' (in minutes). Load it into Automator.  

It is best used in conjunction with a custom Mac Calendar event to trigger it automatically at a certain time
each day.  Remember to set computer to wake up from sleep beforehand if triggering in morning.

Test run it beforehand, as it needs to be able to access accessibility settings, as well approved on the first run.
Also, make sure to use a Calendar that is NOT synced with iCloud or custom file opens will not work.
